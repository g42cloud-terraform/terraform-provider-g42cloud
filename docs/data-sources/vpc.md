# g42cloud\_vpc

g42cloud_vpc provides details about a specific VPC.

This resource can prove useful when a module accepts a vpc id as an input variable and needs to, for example, determine the CIDR block of that VPC.

## Example Usage

The following example shows how one might accept a VPC id as a variable and use this data source to obtain the data necessary to create a subnet within it.

```hcl

variable "vpc_name" {}

data "g42cloud_vpc" "vpc" {
  name = var.vpc_name
}

```
