# g42cloud_rds_instance

Manages RDS instance resource within G42Cloud.

## Example Usage

### create a single db instance

```hcl
resource "g42cloud_networking_secgroup" "secgroup" {
  name        = "terraform_test_security_group"
  description = "terraform security group acceptance test"
}

resource "g42cloud_rds_instance" "instance" {
  name              = "terraform_test_rds_instance"
  flavor            = "rds.pg.n1.large.2"
  vpc_id            = "{{ vpc_id }}"
  subnet_id         = "{{ subnet_id }}"
  security_group_id = g42cloud_networking_secgroup.secgroup.id
  availability_zone = ["{{ availability_zone }}"]

  db {
    type     = "PostgreSQL"
    version  = "12"
    password = "Huangwei!120521"
  }

  volume {
    type = "ULTRAHIGH"
    size = 100
  }

  backup_strategy {
    start_time = "08:00-09:00"
    keep_days  = 1
  }
}
```

### create a primary/standby db instance

```hcl
resource "g42cloud_networking_secgroup" "secgroup" {
  name        = "terraform_test_security_group"
  description = "terraform security group acceptance test"
}

resource "g42cloud_rds_instance" "instance" {

    keep_days  = 1
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) The region in which to create the rds instance resource. If omitted, the
  provider-level region will be used. Changing this creates a new rds instance resource.

* `availability_zone` - (Required, List, ForceNew) Specifies the list of AZ name. Changing this parameter will create a
  new resource.

* `name` - (Required, String) Specifies the DB instance name. The DB instance name of the same type must be unique for
  the same tenant. The value must be 4 to 64 characters in length and start with a letter. It is case-sensitive and can
  contain only letters, digits, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

* `flavor` - (Required, String) Specifies the specification code.

  -> **NOTE:** Services will be interrupted for 5 to 10 minutes when you change RDS instance flavor.

* `db` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the database information. Structure is documented below. Changing this
  parameter will create a new resource.

* `vpc_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the VPC ID. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

* `subnet_id` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the network id of a subnet. Changing this parameter will create a
  new resource.

* `security_group_id` - (Required, String) Specifies the security group which the RDS DB instance belongs to.

* `volume` - (Required, List) Specifies the volume information. Structure is documented below.

* `dss_pool_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the exclusive storage ID for Dec users.
  It is different for each az configuration. When creating an instance for Dec users,
  it is needed to be specified for all nodes of the instance and separated by commas if database instance type is
  not standalone or read-only.

* `fixed_ip` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies an intranet floating IP address of RDS DB instance. Changing this
  parameter will create a new resource.

* `backup_strategy` - (Optional, List) Specifies the advanced backup policy. Structure is documented below.

* `ha_replication_mode` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the replication mode for the standby DB instance.
  Changing this parameter will create a new resource.
  + For MySQL, the value is *async* or *semisync*.
  + For PostgreSQL, the value is *async* or *sync*.
  + For Microsoft SQL Server, the value is *sync*.

  -> **NOTE:** async indicates the asynchronous replication mode. semisync indicates the semi-synchronous replication
  mode. sync indicates the synchronous replication mode.

* `param_group_id` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the parameter group ID. Changing this parameter will create
  a new resource.

* `time_zone` - (Optional, String, ForceNew) Specifies the UTC time zone. For MySQL and PostgreSQL Chinese mainland site

  pair.

The `db` block supports:

* `type` - (Required, String, ForceNew) Specifies the DB engine. Available value are *MySQL*, *PostgreSQL* and
  *SQLServer*. Changing this parameter will create a new resource.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following timeouts configuration options:

* `create` - Default is 30 minute.

## Import

RDS instance can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import g42cloud_rds_instance.instance_1 7117d38e-4c8f-4624-a505-bd96b97d024c
```

But due to some attributes missing from the API response, it's required to ignore changes as below.

```
resource "g42cloud_rds_instance" "instance_1" {
  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      "db",
    ]
  }
}
```
